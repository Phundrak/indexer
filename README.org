#+title: Indexer

This project is a simple indexer for French text in plaintext for now,
richer text later. Hopefully this will eventually support reading
formats such as ~.docx~, ~.odt~, ~.pdf~, and so on.

This project is a university assignment for my /Computer and Web
Techniques/ (/Techniques Informatiques et Web/).

The example stopwords list for French comes from the [[http://members.unine.ch/jacques.savoy/clef/index.html][Université de
Neuchâtel]]. It is not covered by the repository’s license but by the
